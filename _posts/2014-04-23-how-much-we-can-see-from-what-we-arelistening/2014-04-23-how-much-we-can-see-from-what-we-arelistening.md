Just write this post to see(literally see) how much differences there are in a compressed mp3 with lossless FLAC and WAV.

I compared two sessions in TIME(from 《inception》 OST) with three compressed version:
	44.1kHZ       MP3   184kbps
	44.1KHZ 16bit FLAC  608kbps VBR
	44.1kHZ 16bit WAV   1141kbps

First bite:
mp3

flac
![session1_flac]({{ site.posts_img_path }}/2014-04-23-how-much-we-can-see-from-what-we-arelistening/session1_flac.png)

wav
![session1_wav]({{ site.posts_img_path }}/2014-04-23-how-much-we-can-see-from-what-we-arelistening/session1_wav.png)

Hum...I swear they are three different screen snapshot... But I did barely see no difference from those waves... Dead eyes...

So, maybe I should find some session more dynamic, and I choose the the first rise in TIME, see below

mp3

flac

wav

Er... still nothing? Look closer...

Yes! There does have some differences between mp3 with wav!!!
And it's so apparently mp3 lost some tops and bottoms...

Seems I spend another 500% disk space for wav versions does worth something!!! Yep...

But Flac is nearly 50% space occupation of WAV... 
Still feels like listening to WAV. Er....

Don't ask me if I can hear the difference between all these version... That's what I'll never tell... XOXO, geek girl
