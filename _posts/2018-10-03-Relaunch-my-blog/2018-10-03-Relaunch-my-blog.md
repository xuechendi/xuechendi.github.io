It's been a while since my last post, I am hoping to pick up this habbit and record my daily findings, ideas and tech summarization here.

I am gonna turn 30 in less than 6 months, and I feel I am lost. There are so many things to learn and so many goals to reach. And some people I know at my age had already made something, while I am still working and expecting my monthly payment to keep my life move forward. 

Recently, my husband started his 3 years study in UMich, and we started our overseas long-distance relationship life, I tried to apply jobs in Ann Arbor and resulted in zero response. Which makes me to reconsider my current life, why I acted like a good employee with valuable outcomes and improved myself quite much during these years, I still feel I am being trapped.

The conclusion is that, I am trapped by my comfort zone, and there isn't zero other options, while I choose to ignore them. I want to keep every nice thing I have and want to jump from one safe circle to another with zero gap window, and that is what trapped me.

So, I need to make a choice, to keep my current routine or to put myself to something unknown... ...

Hope I will have my conclusion before my 30 birthday.
