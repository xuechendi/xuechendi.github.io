Using VIM as IDE has many benefits, the reason I use VIM is because it's free and I can compile and test on the same machine I wrote.
While it also has some drawbacks, I always leave lots of type errors inside codes, forget to add headers and didn't quote namespaces, etc. And another drawbacks is coding style, after I added one more parameter or change function name, I need to shifts rest of codes in same line to make it align. 

To fix those hassle, I chose to use google-codefmt and YouCompleteMe to make VIM a little bit smart, for now I don't have some features like tagtree, since I feel it is quite convenient for me to use "grep" to find the codes definition. But I do added auto fold in my vimrc, so I can fold function when I don't want to see them.

------

Here is all the steps to make My VIM CPP IDE done. 

### vundle
Vundle is a project used to install plugins and manage plugins in VIM, if you don't have vundle installed, please [click here[](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

### google/vim-codefmt

vim-codefmt is a tool which can help you to do codefmt by vim, two ways can be used to trigger codefmt

1. use ":FormatCode", vim will format your codes by detected code type.
2. add auto format inside vimrc, and every time when you do ":w" for saving, codes will be auto formatted.

Installation of vim-codefmt is listed as below.

1. Change your .vimrc and add below lines in the beginning.
``` bash
set nocompatible
filetype off
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
Plugin 'google/vim-maktaba'
Plugin 'google/vim-codefmt'
Plugin 'google/vim-glaive'
call vundle#end()
call glaive#Install()
" Optional: Enable codefmt's default mappings on the <Leader>= prefix.
Glaive codefmt plugin[mappings]
```

2. Trigger the installation
``` bash
option 1. Launch vim and run :PluginInstall
```
``` bash
option 2. To install from command line: vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

3. now you should installed codefmt, to make it autoformatting, add below lines in your vimrc.
``` bash
augroup autoformat_settings
  autocmd FileType bzl AutoFormatBuffer buildifier
  autocmd FileType c,cpp,proto,javascript AutoFormatBuffer clang-format
  autocmd FileType dart AutoFormatBuffer dartfmt
  autocmd FileType go AutoFormatBuffer gofmt
  autocmd FileType gn AutoFormatBuffer gn
  autocmd FileType html,css,sass,scss,less,json AutoFormatBuffer js-beautify
  autocmd FileType java AutoFormatBuffer google-java-format
  autocmd FileType python AutoFormatBuffer yapf
  " Alternative: autocmd FileType python AutoFormatBuffer autopep8
  autocmd FileType vue AutoFormatBuffer prettier
augroup END
```

4. now open any unformatted codes of yours, and use ":w", you should see codes are shifted.

### YouCompleteMe

YouCompelteMe is a tool to use your Makefile or CMakefile to understand your codes and then provides auto filling advices and diagnose codes error while you writing codes.

[Linux Must Install](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#linux-64-bit)
[Full installation Guide](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#full-installation-guide)

CheckList:
- install python-devel and python3-devel package
- install YouCompeleteMe through Vundle
``` bash
vim ~/.vimrc
set nocompatible
filetype off
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'
call vundle#end()
:wq
Launch vim and run :PluginInstall
```
- Install Clangd compeleter to YouCompleteMe
``` bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --clangd-completer
```
- Compile ycm_core
``` bash
cd ~
mkdir ycm_build
cd ycm_build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp
cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release
```
- Enable C-family Semantic Completion
I used Makefile for now, and use compiledb to generate compilation database
``` bash
pip install compiledb
cd ${CPP project}
compiledb -n make
# now you should see a file called "compile_commands.json" in your root dir.
```

Now, YouCompleteMe should be working for your CPP codes, let's have a try
open one of your cpp code with vim
``` bash
:YcmDiags
```
some infomation will be shown at bottom, if there is no error, it would appear to be "No warinings or errors detected."

Other vimrc settings
``` bash
filetype plugin indent on
" show existing tab with 4 spaces width
set tabstop=2
" when indenting with '>', use 4 spaces width
set shiftwidth=2
" On pressing tab, insert 4 spaces
set expandtab
set foldmethod=indent
set foldnestmax=10
set nofoldenable
set foldlevel=2
" set textwidth=90
set colorcolumn=90
set number
set foldmethod=syntax
hi Folded ctermbg=black
map <C-]> :YcmCompleter GoToImprecise<CR>
let g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_signs = 1
highlight YcmErrorLine ctermfg=White cterm=bold
```
