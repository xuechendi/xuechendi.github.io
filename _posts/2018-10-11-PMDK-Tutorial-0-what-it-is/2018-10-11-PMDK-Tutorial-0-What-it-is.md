title: "Persisten Memory Development Kit(PMDK) Notes 0: What it is and Quick Examples"
date: 2018-10-10
categories: [c/c++, persistent memory, compile, java, PMDK]
abstract: "PMDK is a super cool open source library developed and owned by intel. This lib is used to help users to implement applications on persistent memory just like using normal memory. Which is to say, basically, when we want to manage memory, we allocate a chunk, and use pointers to indicate where data is to build a logical image and do read and write, and that is exactly how to use persistent memory by this PMDK lib. There is a new pointer, persistent_ptr<type>, and it just can be used like a char*, super cool!"
