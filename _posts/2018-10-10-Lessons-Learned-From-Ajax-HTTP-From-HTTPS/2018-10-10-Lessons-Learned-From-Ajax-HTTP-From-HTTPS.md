abstract: "Recently, I am thinking to build a subscribe page, and as this website based on jelyll and set in github, If I want to interact with some dynamic scripts I need to have another server and communicate with this one using ajax. The idea is simple, until I started to submit my codes to github!! Gituhub pages are based on https!!! I never really dig into why there is more and more websites are based on https, and yeah, I see now. This blog is about all lessons I learned from my experiment and my ultimate findings and solutions."
