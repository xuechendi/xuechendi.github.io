abstract: "I noticed there are many ways to post codes in Jekyll, such as iframe or embed, so I tried some in this post, by using leetcode, jupyter through gist and pure C codes through gist. I think I'll use first two options, they are both wonderful for different scenarios, if I want to make my codes testable, I can use leetcode playground. If I want to explain the codes and show output step by step, jupyter version is a great option."
